/*
 Task 1:
    Given an integer array of coins[] of size N representing different types of denominations and an integer sum.
    Task is to count all combinations of coins to make a given value sum.

    Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin.
 
 Task 2:
    Given an array coins[] of size N and a target value sum, where coins[i] represents the coins of different denominations.
    The task is to find minimum number of coins required to make the given value sum. 
    If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.
 
    Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin.
